summary: Apple's breakneck pace of releases is leading to bugs in their software. How bad is it? Should we be playing the blame game?
---

That Apple is losing the software quality it prides itself in, is a narrative that has been gaining steam, and rightfully so. Anecdotally speaking, the number of user-facing bugs in Apple's software has markedly increased in the last couple of years. Each version fixes some and regresses on others. This is not up for debate. However, speculations about the cause, and the (long term) implications of this are certainly very hotly debated. 

Yesterday, [this post](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/04/apple-lost-functional-high-ground) made rounds, and not just around the regular Apple "blogosphere", but also in the national media. While based on a reasonable premise, it soon sidetracked into speculations and conclusions drawn from those speculations. Rightly, the author functionally retracted the article in a [subsequent post](http://www.marco.org/2015/01/05/popular-for-a-day). I think the initial sidetracking muddled an otherwise very sound observation that we have all been making for quite some time.

#### How bad are things?

The bugs are mostly nuisances, with occasional punctuations like [this](http://www.theverge.com/2014/9/24/6839235/apple-ios-8-0-1-released). The intensity of such bugs has historically followed a cyclic pattern; rising around major releases and then ebbing quickly through "minor" releases before another major one is out. This is quite logical and something that is bound to happen. This time is not different, except for one thing. In the recent years, we have seen a significant up-tick in the frequency of major releases. Along with major releases, increased has the frequency of those bug-cycles. We are noticing the tides more regularly. Another one sets in before the last one has left the memory of the swarm. Entirely logical.

In the last two years alone, Apple has advanced iOS more than the previous 5 releases.

And these aren't just puffed-up press releases. iOS 7 completely reimagined the platform and iOS 8 is monumental in ways which took months for even the most astute developers to wrap their heads around (and most of us are still attempting to embrace the enormity of changes that it brought). This is a breakneck pace for *any* software team in the world, and especially for Apple's historically small teams. QA is incredibly hard and then feed through it one of the most complex and one of the most used software in the history of human endeavors, and somethings are gonna slip through.

Now, this is no excuse and the pace is entirely up to Apple to choose, one of the many advantages that come with its fantastically integrated products and tools. However, there is a case to be made for this velocity.

#### Who's to blame?

I am not sure we *can*[^fn-1], from the vantage point of complete outsiders, blame marketing or some executive! Maybe there are other realities out in the wild which are driving this.

Mobile is unprecedented in its influence on the human society and, correspondingly, adoption by people from all parts of the world. It is just unbelievable how far it has come in as few as 8 years. However, iOS was never conceived as an OS for this era[^fn-2]. It was made to power a "simple" Phone-iPod-Internet communicator. Today, it has to run most people's primary computer.

iOS 7 laid the foundation of an OS that recognized user's content as paramount and positioned itself as a canvas for information. iOS 8 opened flood-gates of information through incredibly thoughtfully executed systems. It's really magnificently executed and Apple deserves all the praise in the world. Later this year, Apple is set to pave another avenue for ubiquitous computing and information though the ᴡᴀᴛᴄʜ.

This really, *really*[^fn-3] had to be done. It positions Apple as a forerunner in an era where mobile is the foundation of global communication channels which were not even imagined just a decade ago. It's the machine of choice (and necessity) for work, and play for an incredible number of people. So, maybe it's not all about **us**.

>We don’t need major OS releases every year. We don’t need each OS release to have a huge list of new features. We need our computers, phones, and tablets to work well first so we can enjoy new features released at a healthy, gradual, sustainable pace.

Maybe, this is something that Apple *needed* to do. That Apple deemed essential for keeping alive this revolution that has changed lives for the better, billions of them!

Yes, the changes could have been spread over a longer span of time than two years, but I am fairly certain work on these frameworks began a long time ago. It was probably only now that everything came together for these to become cohesive features worth putting out in hands of hundreds of millions of people. Subsequently, those cycles of bugs and fixes also came along.

Again, what do I know?! Maybe it's just marketing-first policies driving Apple's software into the wall. Or, *maybe* it was a necessity. Neither of those exempt Apple from the (legitimate) blame that is coming their way, and nor should we pretend so. They should be criticized for things they do not get quite right. And, if this does not normalize in a reasonable time, there is a very real possibility that Apple will lose the intangible but unbelievably valuable cachet of a company making things that *Just Work*. However, not having the gusto to move forward and not just embrace, but define opportunities like mobile, would worry me more than ceding some some "high ground".

[^fn-1]: Not just that we *shouldn't*.
[^fn-2]: Really, this is era-defining shift, technologically, culturally, and economically.
